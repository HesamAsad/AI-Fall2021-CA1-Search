### Informed & Uninformed Search

In this project, we are going to find a suitable solution to *Dr. Strange's problem* and implement it, using the informed and uninformed search algorithms that we have learned.

To fight Thanos, Dr. Strange must collect all the potions of the great temple and go to the end of the temple. The Great Temple is a winding temple built by the first wizard. Dr. Strange brings the map of the temple, which is in the form of a checkerboard with the location of the potions. In addition to the said potions, there are medicines that by taking them, another Dr. Strange is created. The new doctor appears in the house at the top left of the board. The new doctor appears in the house at the top left of the table. In each move he can move to one of the four adjacent houses of the current house (up, down, left and right). Good Luck! :)

`BFS`, `IDS`, `A*`, and `weighted A*` algorithms are implemented in order to find the optimal way of getting doctors to the end of the temple.
